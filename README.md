# python-vulnerability-analysis
A Python app that uses the Greynoise API to get data on an entered IP.

<br>

### TODO:

*  Get JSON data correctly dumping into response.json.
* Read and display raw JSON data in the Pyglet window.
* Create an input window for the requested IP address.
* Make the JSON look pretty in the Pyglet window instead of just displaying the raw JSON.
* Add more features like checking vulnerabilities on specific systems/OS and 
all zero-days found in a specific date range.
